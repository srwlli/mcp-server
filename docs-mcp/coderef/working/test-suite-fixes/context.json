  "feature_name": "test-suite-fixes",
  "description": "Fix all 26 failing tests across 5 categories: JSON response format mismatches (7), wrong file path references (6), mock tool names in server tests (6), assertion text mismatches (2), and language detection bug (1). Achieve 100% test pass rate (668/668).",
  "goal": "Achieve 100% test pass rate by fixing all 26 failing tests and identifying necessary handler changes",
  "requirements": [
    "Fix JSON response format mismatch - handlers return text with emojis, tests expect pure JSON",
    "Fix wrong file path references - tests look for CLAUDE.md in tests/integration/ instead of project root",
    "Fix mock tool names - server unit tests use non-existent test_tool and perf_test",
    "Fix assertion text mismatches - error response format uses different keywords than tests expect",
    "Fix language detection bug - analyze_project_for_planning not detecting Python correctly",
    "Identify handler changes needed - document what production code needs modification"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "New test coverage - only fix existing failing tests, don't add new ones"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Identify what needs changed in handlers - both test fixes and handler modifications allowed",
    "Follow existing patterns from conftest.py fixtures",
    "Maintain backward compatibility - don't break existing API contracts"
  ],
