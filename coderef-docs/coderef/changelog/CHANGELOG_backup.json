(2) Severity threshold filtering (critical/major/minor) with hierarchical violation detection. (3) Composition pattern - reuses AuditGenerator for zero code duplication. (4) Terminal-friendly output format: file:line - [severity] message. (5) Exit codes for CI/CD integration (0=pass, 1=fail). (6) Scope filtering (ui_patterns, behavior_patterns, ux_patterns, all). (7) Security hardening: path traversal protection, absolute path rejection, path canonicalization (SEC-001). (8) Complete TypedDict coverage (ConsistencyResultDict, CheckResultDict), input validation, error handling, and structured logging. (9) Integration examples for pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.

          "description": "Implemented Tool #8 (establish_standards) that scans codebase to discover UI/UX/behavior patterns and generates comprehensive standards documentation. Creates 4 markdown files (UI-STANDARDS.md, BEHAVIOR-STANDARDS.md, UX-PATTERNS.md, COMPONENT-INDEX.md) in coderef/standards/ directory. Features: (1) Regex-based pattern discovery for UI components (buttons, modals, colors), behavior patterns (error handling, loading states), and UX flows (navigation, accessibility). (2) Security hardening with path traversal protection, symlink validation, file size limits, and excluded directory filtering. (3) Full architectural compliance (ARCH-001, QUA-001, QUA-002, REF-002, REF-003). (4) Three scan depths: quick (1-2 min), standard (3-5 min), deep (10-15 min). (5) Selective focus areas: ui_components, behavior_patterns, ux_flows, or all. (6) Complete TypedDict coverage, input validation, error handling, and structured logging. This is the foundation tool for the consistency enforcement trilogy (Tools #8, #9, #10).",
