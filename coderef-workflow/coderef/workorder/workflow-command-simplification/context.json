  "feature_name": "workflow-command-simplification",
  "description": "Refactor workflow commands to core essentials - reduce from 33+ commands to just 3 workorder commands (/create-workorder, /complete-workorder, /align-plan). Remove redundant commands and consolidate functionality into internal MCP tool calls.",
  "goal": "Simplify user experience by providing only essential workflow commands while maintaining all functionality through internal MCP tool orchestration",
  "requirements": [
    "Keep /create-workorder (planning phase)",
    "Keep /complete-workorder (execution phase, includes archiving)",
    "Keep /align-plan (TodoWrite task list generation)",
    "Remove 30+ redundant workflow commands from ~/.claude/commands/",
    "Ensure removed commands remain available as MCP tools",
    "Update documentation to reflect simplified command set"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must maintain all functionality (just reorganized)",
    "No breaking changes to MCP tool interfaces",
    "Commands in ~/.claude/commands/ (global deployment)",
    "Cannot modify other MCP servers (coderef-docs, coderef-context, coderef-personas)"
