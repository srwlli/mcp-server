  "feature_name": "test-coderef-injection",
  "goal": "Create a test workorder to prove coderef-context is being injected into planning documents",
  "description": "This is a TEST ONLY workorder. We will NOT execute this feature. The purpose is to run the complete /create-workorder workflow (gather context, analyze project, create plan, validate) on the coderef-workflow project itself, then capture the real coderef-context injections (coderef_scan, coderef_query, coderef_patterns, coderef_impact results) that appear in the planning documents as proof that coderef-context is actively being used.",
  "requirements": [
    "Run /create-workorder workflow completely",
    "Capture analysis.json with real coderef_scan results",
    "Capture plan.json with real coderef_query results",
    "Capture plan.json with real coderef_patterns results",
    "Capture plan.json with real coderef_impact results",
    "Create proof document showing explicit coderef-context injections"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "EXECUTION - do not implement any code changes",
    "Agent assignments - this is planning phase only",
    "Actual feature implementation"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Planning documents only - NO code modifications",
    "Capture real coderef-context output, not mock data",
    "Document explicit tool calls and their outputs",
    "Prove injection through actual planning artifacts"
  ]
