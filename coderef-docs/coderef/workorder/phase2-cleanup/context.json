  "description": "Clean up Phase 2 work-in-progress to restore Phase 1 baseline. Another agent worked on Phase 2 conditional modules in parallel, creating critical bugs (dataclass vs dict mismatch). Need to preserve their work, revert modified files, and restore production-ready state.",
  "goal": "Restore coderef-docs to working Phase 1 baseline while preserving all Phase 2 work for future completion",
  "requirements": [
    "Create backup patch of 3 modified files (characteristics.py, modules/__init__.py, types.py)",
    "Move PHASE-2-HANDOFF.md to workorder directory",
    "Create archive of 11 untracked conditional module files",
    "Revert 3 modified files to Phase 1 baseline",
    "Verify tests pass (13/13)",
    "Update plan.json to mark Phase 2 tasks as blocked",
    "Document Phase 2 status and resumption instructions",
    "Clean commit explaining multi-agent conflict resolution"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must not lose any Phase 2 work",
    "Phase 1 must remain production-ready (100% tests passing)",
    "Must be reversible (patches allow resuming Phase 2)",
    "Single atomic commit for cleanup"
