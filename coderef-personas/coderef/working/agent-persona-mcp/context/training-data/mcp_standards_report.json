  "reportTitle": "Report on Claude Code MCP Standards",
  "introduction": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard designed to enable AI models like Claude to interact with external tools, data sources, and systems in a standardized way. It acts as a universal interface, allowing for seamless data exchange and the execution of functions.",

        "title": "Client-Server Architecture",
        "description": "MCP operates on a client-server model. The MCP client is integrated into the AI application (like a Claude-powered chatbot or an IDE), while the MCP server exposes the specific functionalities of an external tool or data source."
      },
      {
        "title": "Transport Layer",
        "description": "Communication between the client and server is handled via JSON-RPC 2.0. For local integrations, this is done over STDIO, and for remote connections, it uses HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)."
      },
      {
        "title": "Primitives",
        "description": "The protocol is built around three core primitives: Tools (functions that the AI model can execute), Resources (data sources that the AI model can access), and Prompts (pre-defined templates that guide the AI model's interaction with the tools and resources)."

        "title": "Official Documentation and Specification",
        "description": "The official MCP documentation site (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and the GitHub repository (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) are the primary sources for the protocol's specification. It is crucial to adhere to the defined standards for tools, resources, and prompts to ensure interoperability."

        "title": "SDKs and Reference Implementations",
        "description": "Anthropic provides official SDKs for various programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, C#, Java, and more. Using these SDKs is highly recommended to ensure compliance with the protocol and to simplify the development process. Reference implementations for popular services like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub are available on the MCP GitHub organization page (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)."
      },
      {
        "title": "Security",
        "description": "The MCP specification includes an authorization model based on OAuth 2.0. MCP servers are treated as OAuth Resource Servers, which helps in securing access to resources. It is critical to implement proper permissioning for tools to prevent unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration. For sensitive operations, human-in-the-loop verification is a recommended security measure. Be aware of the risk of prompt injection attacks and design your prompts and tool interactions to minimize this risk."
      },
      {
        "title": "Development and Integration",
        "description": "Design your MCP servers to be modular, with each server focusing on a specific integration point. This improves maintainability and reusability. Implement robust error handling in your MCP servers to gracefully handle failures and provide meaningful feedback to the AI model. Anthropic offers an official training course on MCP (https://anthropic.skilljar.com/introduction-to-model-context-protocol) which is a valuable resource for developers."

    "title": "Adoption and Community",
    "description": "MCP has seen adoption from major AI providers like OpenAI and Google DeepMind, as well as companies like Block and Apollo. The growing community and the availability of open-source tools and documentation make it a robust choice for building AI-powered applications."
