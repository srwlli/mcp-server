  "agent_recommendation": "MOVE all 5 UDS schemas to papertrail (plan.json, deliverables.json, architecture.json, readme.json, api.json). These are the core Universal Documentation Standards that validate document structure across the entire CodeRef ecosystem. They are reusable, enforce naming conventions, and validate external contracts. The 4 standards files (BEHAVIOR-STANDARDS.md, COMPONENT-INDEX.md, UI-STANDARDS.md, UX-PATTERNS.md) should NOT move - they are project-specific output files generated from .coderef/ data by enhance-standards.py. Each project will have its own versions of these standards based on its codebase. No validators or QA tools were found in this project - validation is handled programmatically by validator.py which loads the schemas."
