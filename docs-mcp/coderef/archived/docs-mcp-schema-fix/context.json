  "description": "Implement schema-first design for plan.json to ensure consistent structure between create_plan and all downstream consumers (generate_deliverables, execute_plan, etc.)",
  "goal": "Make the planning workflow robust by enforcing a JSON schema contract - eliminating schema mismatch errors like 'string indices must be integers'",
  "requirements": [
    "Create plan.schema.json as single source of truth",
    "Update create_plan to return schema with instructions",
    "Update validate_plan to validate against schema before scoring",
    "Update generate_deliverables_template to handle the defined schema",
    "Add schema_version field to all generated plans",
    "Provide clear error messages on schema violations"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Changing the 10-section plan structure",
    "Adding new planning features",
    "Modifying other MCP tools not related to planning"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must be backward compatible with existing plans where possible",
    "Schema must be human-readable and AI-friendly",
    "No breaking changes to MCP tool signatures"
  ],
