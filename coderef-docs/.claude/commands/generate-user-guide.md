Generate USER-GUIDE documentation for the current project.

Call the `mcp__coderef-docs__generate_individual_doc` tool with:
- project_path: current working directory

This creates comprehensive user onboarding documentation with:
- Table of contents with anchor links
- Prerequisites with verification commands
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Architecture explanations with diagrams
- Explicit command examples and usage patterns
- Common use cases and workflows
- Best practices (Do/Don't/Tips)
- Troubleshooting guide

The document will be saved to coderef/foundation-docs/USER-GUIDE.md

Use this when you need to create user-facing documentation for onboarding and training.
