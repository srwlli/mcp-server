  "handoff_notes": "Phase 5 builds on successful patterns from Phases 1-4. Focus on implementing two new generators with custom scoring algorithms. Both tools follow established MCP patterns (validation at boundaries, error handling, structured logging, TypedDict coverage). Key challenge is implementing meaningful quality/optimization scoring that provides actionable insights. Phase 5 completion enables Phase 6 (Unified Reporting) for cross-category analysis and dashboards."
