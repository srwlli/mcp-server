  "goals": [
    "Establish clear archive workflow for completed projects",
    "Create mid-project agent context system via claude.md files",
    "Document relationship between /gather-context and claude.md files",
    "Enable seamless agent handoff with rapid context acquisition",
    "Preserve project decision history in /archived folder"
  ],

  "description": "Refactor and standardize project management workflows by implementing archive procedures and agent context documentation system. Creates templates and documentation for project-level and phase-level context tracking.",

  "user_stories": [
    "As a project lead, I want completed projects automatically moved to /archived so I can maintain clean /working directory",
    "As a new agent joining mid-project, I want to read claude.md files and understand context in 15-20 minutes instead of 1-2 hours",
    "As a planning agent, I want to understand how context.json (structured) and claude.md (narrative) work together",
    "As a developer, I want to know exactly where to log project decisions and blockers during execution",
    "As an archive reviewer, I want to find completed projects with all artifacts (plan.json, analysis.json, context.json) preserved"
  ],

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Archive workflow documented with folder structure, naming conventions, and process steps",
    "Idea logging workflow documented with template and integration guide",
    "Agent context workflow documented with claude.md templates and usage patterns",
    "Project-level claude.md template created with all required sections",
    "Phase-level claude.md template created with all required sections",
    "Relationship document created explaining /gather-context interaction with claude.md files",
    "All documentation saved as .txt files in coderef/future/ for easy discovery",
    "New feature startup workflow documented from /gather-context through /create-plan"
  ],

  "success_criteria": [
    "New agents can onboard to mid-project in <= 20 minutes using claude.md files",
    "Archive workflow reduces manual project cleanup from 30 minutes to 5 minutes",
    "Ideas captured with consistent format enable better planning",
    "Project context is preserved for historical reference and pattern learning",
    "All workflows are discoverable in /future folder"

  "key_decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "claude.md files separate from plan.json",
      "rationale": "Narrative context serves different purpose than structured plan. Markdown easier for agents to skim quickly.",
      "impact": "Two complementary formats: JSON for parsing, Markdown for rapid human/agent reading"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Project-level AND phase-level claude.md files",
      "rationale": "Project file for architecture/decisions, phase file for current execution status and blockers",
      "impact": "Mid-project agents read 2-3 files (15-20 min) instead of entire plan (1-2 hours)"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Archive folder structure matches working folder naming",
      "rationale": "Enables fast lookup of completed projects, enables pattern discovery across similar features",
      "impact": "Historical search becomes easy: /archived/feature-name/plan.json"

    {
      "decision": ".txt files for future workflows (not .md)",
      "rationale": "Distinguish draft/process documentation from final deliverable documentation",
      "impact": "Easy to identify: .txt = process docs, .md = deliverables"
