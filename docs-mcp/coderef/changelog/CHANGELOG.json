When provided, saves analysis to coderef/working/{feature_name}/analysis.json (matching context.json/plan.json pattern). When omitted, returns analysis without saving (backward compatible). Metadata includes feature_name, saved_to (relative path), and generated_at (ISO timestamp). Features graceful degradation - returns analysis data even if file save fails (sets saved_to=null and includes save_error). Multiple analyses with same feature_name overwrite previous file (single analysis.json per feature, no timestamps). Adds <100ms overhead to ~80ms analysis time.
