Run all 7 inventory tools in sequence for the current project directory: inventory_manifest, dependency_inventory, api_inventory, database_inventory, config_inventory, test_inventory, and documentation_inventory. Execute each MCP tool with project_path set to the current working directory, then provide a combined summary showing file counts, dependency stats, API endpoints, database schemas, config files, test coverage, and documentation metrics. Save all manifests to coderef/inventory/.
