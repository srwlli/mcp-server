  "feature_name": "workflow-scanner-integration",
  "description": "Integrate Phase 1 scanner improvements into coderef-workflow planning and execution workflows. Leverage 95% accurate AST scanner data, relationship graphs (dependencies, imports, calledBy), and complexity metrics (ComplexityScorer) to enhance planning accuracy, impact analysis, and execution tracking.",
  "goal": "Improve planning workflows with full type coverage (interfaces, decorators), automated impact analysis using relationship graphs, and complexity-based effort estimation for execution tracking",
  "requirements": [
    "Planning workflows include interfaces, decorators, type aliases from AST scanner",
    "Impact analysis uses relationship graphs (ElementData.dependencies, ElementData.calledBy, ElementData.imports) for transitive dependencies",
    "Execution tracking incorporates complexity-based effort estimation using ComplexityScorer",
    "Backward compatible with pre-Phase 1 scanner data"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Breaking changes to workflow API",
    "Changes to other MCP servers",
    "UI/dashboard updates"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "No breaking changes to workflow API",
    "Handle missing complexity/relationship fields gracefully (backward compatibility)",
    "Maintain performance - impact analysis must be fast",
    "All implementations in Python (coderef-workflow is Python-based)",
    "Must work with existing .coderef/ structure"
  ],
