  "requirements": [
    "Update /create-workorder command definition to include /align-plan step",
    "Add /align-plan step after validation (becomes Step 9)",

  "constraints": [
    "Single file modification only: ~/.claude/commands/create-workorder.md",

    "Workflow must remain logical and clear for users"
  ],
  "success_criteria": {
    "documentation_updated": "create-workorder.md reflects new workflow with /align-plan",
