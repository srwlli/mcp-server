Generate comprehensive documentation inventory for current project.

Discover and analyze documentation files across multiple formats (Markdown, RST, AsciiDoc, HTML, Org-mode), calculate quality metrics (freshness, completeness, coverage), and generate documentation manifest.

Calls the `mcp__docs-mcp__documentation_inventory` tool with the current working directory as the project_path.

Saves manifest to `coderef/inventory/documentation.json`.
