  "feature_name": "coderef-docs-enhancements",
  "workorder_id": "WO-CODEREF-DOCS-ENHANCEMENTS-001",
  "description": "Enhance coderef-docs with documentation-specific features that complement its foundation documentation generation purpose. Focus on navigation, discoverability, accuracy, and maintenance of generated documentation artifacts.",
  "goal": "Make generated foundation docs (README, ARCHITECTURE, API, SCHEMA, COMPONENTS) more discoverable, maintainable, and useful to both humans and agents by adding documentation-specific enhancements.",
  "requirements": [
    "Feature 1: Incremental regeneration - Only rescan changed files instead of full codebase on subsequent runs",
    "Feature 2: Better code examples - Improved code chunking that shows related context and integrates with other docs",
    "Feature 3: Semantic ranking - Order sections/endpoints by importance/frequency instead of alphabetical",
    "Feature 4: Auto-generated TOC - Automatic table of contents with nested structure and cross-links",
    "Feature 5: Cross-references - Automatic linking between docs (README→ARCHITECTURE, ARCHITECTURE→API, API→SCHEMA)",
    "Feature 6: Out-of-date detection - Scan for deprecated APIs, moved functions, changed signatures and flag for updates",
    "Support relationship diagrams in ARCHITECTURE.md for visualizing module dependencies and data flow",
    "Add documentation completeness scoring to identify gaps (e.g., missing response codes, usage examples)",
    "Tools should integrate with coderef-context tools but maintain distinct purposes (docs are reference material, not task-specific context)"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Multi-turn conversation features (docs are static, not interactive)",
    "Complete redesign of existing docs generation (only enhancements)",
    "Real-time doc watching (batch regeneration is sufficient)",
    "Custom visualization frameworks (use simple markdown + ASCII diagrams)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must not duplicate coderef-context functionality - maintain separation of concerns",
    "Incremental indexing must not degrade accuracy (must still catch all changes)",
    "Documentation must remain readable as markdown (not require special viewers)",
    "Out-of-date detection must not produce false positives (high precision)",
    "Performance: Full regeneration should complete in <30 seconds for typical projects"
  ],
  "success_criteria": {
    "feature_completeness": "All 6 features implemented and tested",
    "performance": "Second-run incremental regeneration <5 seconds (vs first-run 30 seconds)",
    "accuracy": "Out-of-date detection >95% precision (minimal false positives)",
    "usability": "Generated docs have working cross-references between all 5 foundation docs",
    "quality": "TOC is auto-generated and matches document structure 100%",
    "integration": "Works alongside coderef-context tools without conflicts"
  },
  "estimated_complexity": "High (6 coordinated features, tight performance requirements)",
  "estimated_duration": "40-50 hours"
}
