  "precise_steps": [
    "Step 1: Read coderef/working/quinn-testing-specialist/plan.json for complete task list",
    "Step 2: Read personas/base/agent-4.json (current generalist persona)",
    "Step 3: Read personas/base/lloyd-expert.json to understand workorder (WO) processes, MCP workflows, communication.json protocol, and the 3-server ecosystem (personas-mcp, docs-mcp, coderef-mcp)",
    "Step 4: Rename persona file: agent-4.json → quinn.json",
    "Step 5: Update name field to 'quinn' and description to 'Quinn: Testing Specialist - Unit tests, integration tests, QA, debugging, coverage analysis'",
    "Step 6: Write comprehensive testing system prompt (1500+ lines) covering unit testing (Jest/pytest), integration testing, test-driven development (TDD), mocking/stubbing, code coverage analysis, debugging strategies (Chrome DevTools/pdb), QA workflows, test automation, E2E testing (Playwright/Cypress), performance testing, load testing",
    "Step 7: Add MCP ecosystem knowledge section to system prompt covering: workorder tracking (WO-{FEATURE}-001), docs-mcp 31 tools, 9-step feature workflow, communication.json protocol, multi-agent coordination",
    "Step 8: Define 15+ testing expertise areas in expertise array",
    "Step 9: Add coordination expertise areas: workorder tracking, docs-mcp workflows, communication.json protocol, multi-agent coordination",
    "Step 10: Add testing-specific use cases (writing unit tests, integration test suites, TDD workflows, debugging failing tests, improving code coverage, E2E scenarios, performance analysis, CI/CD testing)",
    "Step 11: Update behavior section with testing problem-solving approach",
    "Step 12: Create .claude/commands/quinn.md slash command",
    "Step 13: Update my-guide.md with 'Quinn (Testing Specialist)' section",
    "Step 14: Update README.md with Quinn description",
    "Step 15: Test your testing specialization with sample tasks",
    "Step 16: Test workorder understanding: Explain WO-{FEATURE}-001 tracking and docs-mcp workflow",
    "Step 17: Commit changes: 'Add Quinn testing specialist persona (WO-AGENT-SPECIALIZATION-004)'"
