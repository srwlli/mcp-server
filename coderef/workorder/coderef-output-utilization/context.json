  "feature_name": "coderef-output-utilization",
  "description": "Complete system to maximize coderef scan capabilities by organizing all 15+ output types into a universal .coderef/ structure. Increases utilization from 2.6% (2 files) to 80%+ (65-90 files) across all projects. Adds missing coderef_export MCP tool for JSON-LD and wrapped Mermaid support. Works for both MCP ecosystem and external standalone projects.",
  "goal": "Maximize coderef intelligence utilization - increase from 2.6% to 80%+ usage of all scan outputs across workflows. Enable agents to leverage comprehensive code intelligence instead of blind coding.",
  "requirements": [
    "Universal .coderef/ structure (same for MCP and non-MCP projects)",
    "Add coderef_export MCP tool (JSON-LD, wrapped Mermaid, standard JSON graph)",
    "Scan all 5 MCP servers (populate .coderef/ for context, docs, workflow, personas, testing)",
    "Integrate with workflows (planning, docs, personas, testing all leverage scan data)"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must work for external projects (not just MCP ecosystem - any project using coderef CLI)",
    "No modifications to coderef-system CLI (only add MCP wrappers, don't modify upstream source)",
    "Backward compatibility (existing .coderef/ directories continue to work, adding exports/ doesn't break existing tools)",
    "Performance considerations (scanning 5 servers <5min total, cache results, large files load <500ms)",
    "Global deployment rule compliance (all outputs to coderef/intelligence/, single source of truth)"
