# Project: {FEATURE_NAME}
**Status:** Planning
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Current Agent:** [Name/ID]

## Quick Summary
[1-2 sentence overview of what this feature does]

Example:
> This feature adds a dark mode toggle to the application settings, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes with automatic persistence.

## Project Goals
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

Example:
- Implement theme toggle in settings panel
- Persist user preference to localStorage
- Apply theme styles across all components

## Architecture Overview
[Paragraph describing overall system design, key components, tech stack]

Example:
> This feature uses React Context for theme state management, with a custom hook `useTheme()` providing access throughout the component tree. Styles are handled through CSS-in-JS with styled-components, allowing dynamic theme switching. The theme preference persists to localStorage and is restored on app startup.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Decision 1:** [What] → [Why] → [Impact]
- **Decision 2:** [What] → [Why] → [Impact]

Example:
- **Context API over Redux:** Simpler state management for localized theme state → Reduces bundle size and complexity → No Redux integration needed
- **CSS-in-JS over CSS variables:** Supports dynamic color manipulation → Better support for theme transitions → Slightly larger runtime footprint

## Current Phase
**Phase:** 1 of 3 - UI Component Build
**Progress:** 35% complete
**Started:** 2025-10-10
**Est. Completion:** 2025-10-20

## Known Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: [Description] - [Status/Owner]
- [ ] Blocker 2: [Description] - [Status/Owner]

Example:
- [ ] Color palette inconsistency: Light mode colors don't match brand guidelines → Awaiting design review → @design-team
- [ ] styled-components version conflict: Peer dependency issue with React 18 → Testing alternative → @tech-lead

## Dependencies
- [External service/library]: [version/status]
- [Database/config]: [current state]
- [Related features]: [link to other projects]

Example:
- styled-components: ^5.3.0 (installed, tested with React 18)
- localStorage API: Native browser (no external dependency)
- Related: User authentication system (needed for per-user preferences)
