  "feature_name": "mcp-http-server",
  "description": "HTTP wrapper for docs-mcp server to enable ChatGPT integration via OpenAI's MCP connector protocol. Exposes existing MCP tools through REST API endpoints that ChatGPT can call.",
  "goal": "Enable ChatGPT to directly call docs-mcp tools (documentation generation, changelog management, standards extraction, etc.) through a public HTTPS endpoint. Future: extend to general web API access.",
  "requirements": [
    "HTTP POST endpoint at /mcp that accepts tool name and arguments",
    "Health check endpoint at /health for monitoring and Railway deployment checks",
    "Tool discovery endpoint at /tools that lists all 17 available MCP tools with descriptions",
    "Reuse existing tool_handlers.py - wrap handlers with HTTP routing, no code duplication",
    "Flask-based Python web server (lightweight, simple)",
    "Compatible with Railway.app deployment (Procfile, PORT env var)",
    "Python 3.11+ compatibility",
    "Proper error handling and JSON responses",
    "Return MCP tool results as JSON to ChatGPT"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Authentication/API keys (v1 is open access)",
    "Rate limiting (add in v2)",
    "CORS support (add when building web UI in future)",
    "Async job queue (all requests synchronous for MVP)",
    "Database or persistent storage",
    "Caching layer",
    "Request validation beyond basic JSON parsing",
    "User management or sessions"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use Flask web framework for simplicity",
    "Must reuse all 17 existing MCP tool handlers from tool_handlers.py",
    "Must work with Python 3.11+",
    "Must be Railway.app compatible (Procfile, PORT binding)",
    "Must preserve existing MCP server functionality (no breaking changes)",
    "Keep it simple - minimal dependencies beyond Flask",
    "Response format must match ChatGPT's MCP connector expectations"
  ],
  "deployment_target": "Railway.app",
  "primary_use_case": "ChatGPT integration via OpenAI MCP connector",
  "future_enhancements": [
    "General REST API for web applications",
    "Authentication and rate limiting",
    "CORS support for browser-based clients",
    "API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI",
    "Webhooks for async operations"
