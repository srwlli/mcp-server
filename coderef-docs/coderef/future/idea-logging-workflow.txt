IDEA LOGGING WORKFLOW FOR MCP INTEGRATION
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Log and capture initial ideas, observations, and contextual notes for MCP
integration work. Create LIGHTWEIGHT reference documentation for quick
context retrieval during implementation planning.

**IMPORTANT**: Idea logs are intentionally MINIMAL - just enough to capture
the core concept. They are designed to feed into the /gather-context workflow,
which handles comprehensive requirements gathering through interactive questions.

================================================================================
WORKFLOW OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1. IDEA CAPTURE
   When a new idea, observation, or requirement emerges:
   - Record the idea immediately
   - Capture the context/reason it emerged
   - Note any related existing work
   - Link to relevant files or conversations

2. LOGGING LOCATION:
   File: @docs-mcp\coderef\future\{idea-name}.txt
   Format: Plain text, timestamped entries
   Naming: kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens)

3. MINIMAL STRUCTURE:
   Each idea log should contain:
   - Title/Headline
   - Date/Timestamp captured
   - Brief description (1-3 sentences)
   - Context/Why this matters
   - Related references or links
   - Current status/next steps

================================================================================
IDEA LOG TEMPLATE
================================================================================

IDEA: [Short descriptive title in CAPS]
DATE: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
STATUS: [Proposed/In Discussion/Ready for Planning/In Progress]

DESCRIPTION:
[1-3 sentence overview of the idea]

CONTEXT:
[Why this idea emerged, what problem it solves, or what opportunity it presents]

RELATIONSHIP TO MCP:
[How this integrates with MCP ecosystem or MCP integration goals]

RELATED WORK:
- [Link or reference to existing plans/documents]
- [Link or reference to code sections]
- [Link or reference to conversations]

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS:
- [Key consideration 1]
- [Key consideration 2]
- [Potential blocker or question]

NEXT STEPS:
- [ ] Use /gather-context to capture detailed requirements
- [ ] Move to planning phase when ready
- [ ] Archive to /archived/ once executed

================================================================================
EXAMPLE IDEA LOGS
================================================================================

IDEA: HTTP-SERVER-MCP-BRIDGE
DATE: 2025-10-15 14:30
STATUS: In Discussion

DESCRIPTION:
Create an MCP server that bridges HTTP requests to standard MCP protocols,
allowing CLI tools to communicate with HTTP-based APIs through MCP.

CONTEXT:
Many existing tools use HTTP endpoints. By creating a bridge MCP server,
we could standardize communication and reduce integration complexity.

RELATIONSHIP TO MCP:
Core MCP tool, extends MCP usability for HTTP-based ecosystems.

RELATED WORK:
- mcp-http-server (folder in future)
- MCP-DEV-LOG-PROPOSAL.md

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS:
- Could use Express.js for HTTP layer
- Need to map HTTP routes to MCP protocol handlers
- Consider rate limiting and error handling

NEXT STEPS:
- [ ] Define HTTP to MCP mapping strategy
- [ ] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Archive when implementation complete

================================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH MCP WORKFLOW
================================================================================

1. IDEA ENTRY POINT:
   Ideas can originate from:
   - Development observations
   - User feedback or feature requests
   - Architectural discussions
   - Code review findings
   - Integration pain points

2. FROM IDEA TO PLAN:
   Idea Log → /gather-context → /analyze-for-planning → /create-plan → Archive

   When ready to execute:
   - Use idea log as starting point
   - Run /gather-context to capture detailed requirements (CRITICAL STEP)
     * Agent asks interactive questions based on idea log
     * Captures goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints
     * Creates context.json in coderef/working/{feature-name}/
   - Run /analyze-for-planning to gather project data
   - Run /create-plan to generate implementation plan
   - Execute plan per archive-workflow.txt

3. IDEA LOG LIFECYCLE:
   Proposed → In Discussion → Ready for Planning → Archived

   - Proposed: Initial capture, gathering feedback
   - In Discussion: Refining details with team
   - Ready for Planning: Sufficient context to begin implementation
   - Archived: Plan executed and feature complete

4. NAMING CONSISTENCY:
   Idea logs use same naming as feature folders:
   - idea-logging-workflow.txt (general workflow document)
   - mcp-http-server.txt (specific idea)
   - agent-persona.txt (if documenting persona approach)

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST
================================================================================

When capturing a new idea:
- [ ] Filename in kebab-case.txt
- [ ] Placed in coderef/future/ folder
- [ ] Date/timestamp included
- [ ] Status field set
- [ ] 1-3 sentence description written
- [ ] Context section explains "why"
- [ ] Related work referenced
- [ ] Next steps outlined
- [ ] Ready for quick team review

When promoting idea to plan:
- [ ] Run /gather-context with idea log as reference
- [ ] Update idea log status to "In Progress"
- [ ] Run /analyze-for-planning (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Run /create-plan to generate implementation plan
- [ ] Link back from plan to idea log for reference
- [ ] Archive both when complete

================================================================================
KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLE
================================================================================

Idea logs are LIGHTWEIGHT by design. They are NOT comprehensive specifications.

WHAT IDEA LOGS ARE:
- Quick capture (5-10 minutes to write)
- Core concept and context
- Starting point for /gather-context workflow
- 10-20 lines of structured notes

WHAT IDEA LOGS ARE NOT:
- Comprehensive requirements (that's /gather-context's job)
- Implementation plans (that's /create-plan's job)
- Technical specifications (that's /analyze-for-planning's job)

THE WORKFLOW:
1. Idea Log - Lightweight capture (5-10 min)
2. /gather-context - Detailed requirements via interactive questions (15-30 min)
3. /analyze-for-planning - Technical analysis (automated, ~1 min)
4. /create-plan - Full implementation plan (automated, ~2 min)

This separation ensures:
- Fast idea capture without friction
- Comprehensive requirements gathering when needed
- Agent asks relevant questions based on idea context

================================================================================
BENEFITS OF IDEA LOGGING
================================================================================

- Low-barrier capture: Quick notes don't require full planning
- Context preservation: Future reference without re-investigating
- Team alignment: Shared understanding of what we're building
- Integration history: Track how MCP-related ideas evolved
- Reference material: Examples for similar future ideas
- Status tracking: Quick view of what's proposed vs. planned
- Workflow integration: Feeds directly into /gather-context
