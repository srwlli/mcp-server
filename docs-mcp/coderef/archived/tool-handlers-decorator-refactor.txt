IDEA: TOOL-HANDLERS-DECORATOR-REFACTOR
DATE: 2025-10-16
STATUS: Proposed

DESCRIPTION:
Refactor tool_handlers.py to reduce repetitive boilerplate using decorators and helper abstractions.

CONTEXT:
Current file has 2168 lines with ~35% repetitive error handling, validation, and logging patterns across 21 handlers. Extracting common patterns would improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

RELATIONSHIP TO MCP:
Core MCP server implementation - affects all 21 tool handlers.

RELATED WORK:
- tool_handlers.py (target file)
- error_responses.py (ARCH-001 error factory)
- validation.py (REF-003 input validation)
- logger_config.py (ARCH-003 logging)

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS:
- Create decorators for common patterns (error handling, validation, logging)
- Extract response formatting helpers
- Reduce boilerplate by 25-35% (~500-800 lines)

NEXT STEPS:
- [ ] Use /gather-context to capture requirements
- [ ] Design decorator interface
- [ ] Create implementation plan
