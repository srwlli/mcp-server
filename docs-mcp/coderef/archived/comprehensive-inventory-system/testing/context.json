  "feature_name": "comprehensive-inventory-system-testing",
  "description": "Comprehensive testing plan for all 8 inventory tools (inventory_manifest, dependency_inventory, api_inventory, database_inventory, config_inventory, test_inventory, documentation_inventory) to verify correct functionality, output accuracy, security hardening, performance, and error handling.",
  "goal": "Verify that all 8 inventory tools work correctly across various project scenarios and generate accurate, secure manifests before v2.0.0 production deployment.",
  "requirements": [
    "Test all 8 inventory tools (Tools #16-23)",
    "Test against active project in external environment (not docs-mcp)",
    "Verify all aspects: functionality, correctness, security, performance, error handling",
    "Generate comprehensive test results and validation reports",
    "Ensure manifests are accurate and contain expected data structure",
    "Verify security features (sensitive value masking, path validation)",
    "Measure performance (tools complete within acceptable time)",
    "Test error handling for edge cases and malformed inputs"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Automated CI/CD test suite creation (manual testing only)",
    "Unit-level testing of individual generator classes",
    "Documentation of test procedures (focus on execution, not documentation)",
    "Load testing with extremely large projects (10K+ files)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "External project must be available and accessible",
    "Testing must work across different tech stacks (Python, Node.js, etc.)",
    "Must preserve external project integrity (no modifications)",
    "Must work with docs-mcp v2.0.0 current implementation",
    "Results must be saved to testing directory for review"
  ],
  "testing_scope": {
    "tools_to_test": "All 8 (manifest, dependency, api, database, config, test, documentation)",
    "depth": "Comprehensive (unit + integration + edge cases)",
    "target_projects": "Active project in external environment",
    "test_areas": [
      "Basic functionality - tools execute without errors",
      "Output correctness - manifests have correct data",
      "Security - sensitive values masked, path traversal prevented",
      "Performance - tools complete in acceptable time",
      "Error handling - graceful failures on malformed input"
    ],
    "test_format": "Manual testing (no automated suite)"
  },
  "deliverables": [
    "Test execution log with all 8 tools tested",
    "Sample manifests from each tool (inventory.json, dependencies.json, api.json, database.json, config.json, tests.json, documentation.json)",
    "Security validation report (sensitive values properly masked)",
    "Performance metrics (execution time per tool)",
    "Error handling test results",
    "Overall validation summary"
  ]
