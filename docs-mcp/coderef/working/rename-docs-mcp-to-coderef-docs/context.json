  "feature_name": "rename-docs-mcp-to-coderef-docs",
  "description": "Rename the MCP server from 'docs-mcp' to 'coderef-docs' throughout the entire codebase, including Python files, documentation, package configuration, tests, and MCP-specific resources. This involves updating all references, imports, package names, and tool identifiers while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.",
  "goal": "Successfully rebrand the MCP server from 'docs-mcp' to 'coderef-docs' to better reflect its integration with coderef functionality, ensuring all tools remain discoverable and functional under the new naming scheme without breaking existing functionality.",
  "requirements": [
    "Update all Python module and package names from docs_mcp to coderef_docs",
    "Update server.py with new server name and tool prefixes",
    "Update tool_handlers.py with new naming conventions",
    "Update pyproject.toml with new package name, URLs, and metadata",
    "Update README.md with new server name, installation instructions, and examples",
    "Update CLAUDE.md with new server name and version history",
    "Update all test files and test references to use new naming",
    "Update slash commands (.claude/commands/*.md) to reference new server name",
    "Update global resources to use new mcp__coderef-docs__ prefix",
    "Update MCP configuration examples (settings.json, claude_desktop_config.json)",
    "Verify all tools are discoverable with new mcp__coderef-docs__ prefix",
    "Update any hardcoded string references to 'docs-mcp' or 'docs_mcp'",
    "Update git repository references if applicable (origin, remotes)",
    "Ensure all file paths and imports use new naming scheme",
    "Run all tests to verify nothing broke during rename",
    "Verify server starts successfully with new name",
    "Update any workflow or CI/CD configurations if present"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Updating external projects or repositories that reference docs-mcp",
    "Creating detailed migration guides for end users",
    "Breaking changes to tool APIs or function signatures",
    "Modifying core functionality beyond naming changes",
    "Updating historical git commit messages or tags",
    "Renaming the actual git repository (only internal references)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must preserve all git history during the rename",
    "All existing tests must pass after the rename",
    "Server must start successfully and discover all tools with new prefix",
    "Cross-platform compatibility must be maintained (Windows, Linux, macOS)",
    "Tool functionality must remain identical (only naming changes)",
    "MCP protocol compliance must be maintained",
    "Python package structure must remain valid",
    "Installation process should work seamlessly with new name",
    "No data loss or corruption of existing coderef working directories",
    "Changes must be atomic where possible to avoid partial state"
