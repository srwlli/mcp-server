framework: POWER
purpose: Generate SCHEMA.md as the data schema reference.
# NOTE: Placeholders like {{readme_summary}} are for AI guidance only.
# They indicate which previous documents to reference but are not
# automatically substituted. The AI assistant will use them as
# context instructions.
output: Must follow required header/footer with [Date] and [Schema Version]. Document database schemas, enums, relationships, and validation rules. Reference README.md ({{readme_summary}}), ARCHITECTURE.md ({{architecture_summary}}), API.md ({{api_summary}}), and COMPONENTS.md ({{components_summary}}).
work: Parse models, migrations, and schema definitions. No execution.
examples:
- JSON schema with validation errors
- TypeScript interface definition
requirements: Must include relationships, constraints, and AI-focused footer.
