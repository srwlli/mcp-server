## Usage Notes

### Finding Features by Workorder

Search for features using their workorder ID pattern:
```
WO-{FEATURE-NAME}-{NUMBER}
```

Example: `WO-AUTH-SYSTEM-001`

### Feature Lifecycle

```
/create-workorder → context.json + analysis.json + plan.json
       ↓
/execute-plan → implementation (progress tracked in plan.json)
       ↓
/update-deliverables → DELIVERABLES.md with metrics
       ↓
/update-docs → changelog, README, CLAUDE.md updates
       ↓
/archive-feature → moves to coderef/archived/
```
