Generate a scannable quickref guide for ANY application (CLI, Web App, API, Desktop, Library).

This workflow uses an AI-driven interview to gather information about your application, then generates a comprehensive quickref.md following a proven scannable pattern.

**Interview Workflow:**

The AI will guide you through 9 steps to gather information:

1. **Basic Info**: App name, description, type (CLI/Web/API/Desktop/Library)
2. **Core Capabilities**: 4-5 main things the app does
3. **Actions/Commands**: Available actions with purpose and timing
4. **Features/Tools**: Main features grouped by category
5. **Common Workflows**: 3-5 common use cases with step-by-step sequences
6. **Outputs/Results**: Where outputs go (files, directories, screens)
7. **Key Concepts**: 2-4 important patterns or workflows (optional)
8. **Generate & Save**: AI creates quickref.md in universal format
9. **Review**: Preview and request any changes

**Universal 8-Section Pattern:**

The generated quickref will include:
- **At a Glance**: 4-5 core capabilities
- **Actions/Commands**: What users can DO (table format)
- **Features/Tools**: Functionality grouped by category
- **Common Workflows**: Step-by-step numbered sequences
- **Reference Format**: Copy-paste examples
- **Output Locations**: Where results/files are stored
- **Key Concepts**: Important patterns (2-4 items)
- **Summary**: Total counts and links

**Target**: 150-250 lines, scannable in <30 seconds

**Output Location**: `coderef/quickref.md`

**Usage**: Just answer the AI's questions in plain English - the AI will handle the rest.
