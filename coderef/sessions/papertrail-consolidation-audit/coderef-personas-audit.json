DO NOT MOVE: (1) All 4 standards files - currently empty placeholders with no actual content, (2) tests/test_validators.py - project-specific test file tightly coupled to src/validators.py implementation. The validator code represents a valuable pattern (3-stage validation: schema → semantic → quality) that could be generalized into a reusable validation framework for papertrail, but currently has persona-specific dependencies (checking names against personas/base/ directory, persona-specific semantic checks)."
