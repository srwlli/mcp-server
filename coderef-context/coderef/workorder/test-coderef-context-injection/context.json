  "feature_name": "test-coderef-context-injection",
  "goal": "Create a test workorder to prove coderef-context is functional and can analyze code",
  "description": "This is a TEST ONLY workorder. We will NOT execute this feature. The purpose is to run the complete /create-workorder workflow on the coderef-context project itself, then capture the real coderef-context self-analysis results as proof that code intelligence works.",
  "requirements": [
    "Run /create-workorder workflow completely",
    "Capture analysis.json with real coderef_scan results of coderef-context itself",
    "Capture plan.json with coderef_query, coderef_patterns results",
    "Document how coderef-context analyzes itself (recursive proof)",
    "Show the CLI wrapper, subprocess management, and tool handlers"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "EXECUTION - do not implement any code changes",
    "Agent assignments - this is planning phase only",
    "Actual feature implementation"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Planning documents only - NO code modifications",
    "Capture real coderef-context output, not mock data",
    "Analyze coderef-context project itself (recursive)"
  ]
